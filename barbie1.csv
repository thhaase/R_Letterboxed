"Türkiz","I cried my heart out to this film. Maybe I watched it at the wrong time or maybe the perfect. I am dealing with anxiety, depression and existential crisis lately and this movie really made me feel seen. It articulated the ideas that haunts my brain since forever that I couldn’t put into words sometimes. Thank you Greta for making this movie, understanding and representing women and making us feel united🩷","23 Jul 2023",4

"krissy","this was so fun i enjoyed all the references to classic barbies as well as the pink theme and outfits. the deeper message a out womanhood was great but they were definitely pushing it a bit towards the end. the jokes were great and the ken’s were great comic relief however i think the scenes towards the end started to drag","23 Jul 2023",4

"AdilsonJunior","O filme é propositalmente exagerado e repete muitas falas mas nunca se perde, consegue ser extremamente divertido e engraçado. Gosto particularmente de como a Greta está inspirada nesse filme tanto em planos e visual (as sequências musicais com o Ken exemplificam muito bem) como nos diálogos, aqui ela tem liberdade para expor todas as suas ideias e crenças mas faz tudo com muita naturalidade dentro desse mundo tão absurdo.","22 Jul 2023",4

"Türkiz","Barbie follows a path that was laid down by the Lego Movie in the highly meta narrative about a popular toy product and could easily have been a pale imitator but does an excellent job in forging its own identity and becoming one of the most instantly iconic films of the year.It's a movie that treads a fine line in many regards, with the narrative aesthetic and jokes all things that could have easily fallen falt and generated a…","23 Jul 2023",4

Rarely subtle, always telling you exactly what they want to tell you. Sometimes that works, sometimes it was a tant too much explaining. Always trying to evade the style over substance tag.

"Ashley Joyce","「妳很美」「我知道」 葛莉塔潔薇選擇以最直接、甚至二元的方式切入性別議題，呈現男女處境顛倒的芭比樂園/現實世界，在戳破粉色泡影後的女性（還有肯尼）自我賦權。芭比不再只是金髮碧眼的九頭身美女，可以是總統、醫生、家庭主婦、或大腿上長橘皮的普通人。雖說清楚明瞭這項議題的重要性，以及如何以此翻新「芭比」這個玩具的時代意義，但電影後半對我而言還是偏功能性，服務議題的痕跡稍嫌生硬，尤其一些演說橋段有點覺得說教感稍重（這種演講在《她們》時葛莉塔就用過，那時我就不太買單） 不過，電影裡的美術實在迷人，夢幻的芭比換裝秀和芭比樂園的設計都很好看，而且看喜歡、眼熟的演員們一起演這種怪片怪角色真的很可愛，笑點拋出的時間、內容也掌握的挺好（愛死photoshop那個） 結局原以為是類似《玩具總動員4》的胡迪一樣，芭比找到自己新的世界和新的意義，可這樣的收束卻讓我感到有點莫名，原以為會解釋芭比的自我賦權會是超脫性別的成長，卻又轉個彎回到女性的概念實在有點可惜。可見《芭比》雖有瑕疵，但不妨礙大家對這部片的喜愛（包含我），相信他的出現會是對女性的鼓舞，也想起小時候我也有過被畫了妝、總愛劈腿的芭比。 —mur—1.芭比ㄉ愛心是粉紅色 可愛死2.跟朋友全身粉 路人：這一看就是去看芭比的3.前面有人滑手機螢幕還超亮 this Barbie is angry 4.那麼 哪裡買得到憂鬱芭比呢？","22 Jul 2023",5

"SamuraiDrifter","Whimsical production design and strong comical performances aside, the film tries to grapple with themes of womanhood and gender identity, but chooses to hammer in politics without too much to say. Representations of gender are envisioned as hyperbolic binaries; surprisingly black-and-white for a pink-filled film. Its ironic-sardonic tone turns grating towards the halfway mark; the little (at times shallow, or non-existent) contrast between Barbieland and Real World feels just a huge missed opportunity.

This movie has no subtly. No show and all tell. Also, a lot of scenes are underutilized. The real world is all very dramaticized and just not enough in it. Will Ferrell and the execs are useless. The chase scene is absolutely painful. This still gets a high rating since it was still decent and makes its point, but it does not live up to the hype.","22 Jul 2023",5

But then about halfway through it turned into a ham fisted drama with incredibly lame dialogue. Gloria’s speech about what it’s like being a woman was (and I say this as a proud feminist and misandrist) almost too cringe to bare. I also hated the scenes with the creator of barbie?

It’s just sad how so many kids in the theatre just yawned and asked «how mich left?»….I love how they made barbie and ken equal, or at least more equal? ir they were going to atleast? I hope so. I liked it a lot, it showed how our society behaves. And I love how the ken’s represented women in the real world, and how women are treated.

"Zuzanna","More hollow than the reviews I saw suggested. I think that although the monologues were filled with truly beautiful sentiments and imagery, they ultimately didn't resonate fully because the themes presented weren't strongly supported by the narrative.

An essentially satirical coming-of-age dramedy at heart, Barbie plays at harsh realities women commonly face in the “real world.” Genuinely hilarious, fun and quirky, but never comes off as “corny.” Moving, but never comes off as disingenuous.

Not only that, there is a background story arch for Ken to which reminds men that they should also strive to find what they want out of life besides just being a boyfriend, husband, etc. Fantastic movie that hides darker under tones with the classic Barbie pink.

I will be incorporating ""SubLIME!"" into my vocabulary forever. I bruised my tailbone trying to roller skate the day before which really added to the experience.","23 Jul 2023",5

Ryan Gosling also serves as an outstanding foil for all the glam-feminism with his head-empty fragile machismo.

Critically speaking, it was a movie that thrived when it embraced the ambiguity of adult life and the way concepts of masculinity, men’s issues, women’s empowerment, and patriarchy hint at real issues in life but through a prism and in overly abstract ways. Gender isn’t as simple as in our fantasy formations. It…","23 Jul 2023",3

The fallacy of Barbie doll is that it evokes complex feelings about womanhood within you while you aspire to resemble its perfection and…","23 Jul 2023",3

Barbie is a movie for women but men can enjoy the ride as well. Michael Cera killed it and I wish he had more screen time. Feel like some of the feminism stuff was heavily over exaggerating but whatever. Ryan Gosling and Margot were literally perfectly casted for this role.

The film talked about womanhood and manhood in a careful and sensitive manner. One cannot deny the depths of Allen and Ken. Allen, was seen by the Kens as someone who is always outside of the group, rendering him being an outcast, a shadow, a queering figure within the Barbie world. Allen was always marginalized, never part…","23 Jul 2023",4

"Arturo Garza","An amazingly gorgeous movie with plenty of moments of real laughs and real catharsis, surrounded by a movie that, at times, pulled its punches to try to keep the laughs flowing. I truly enjoyed Barbie, even if it ruined my ability to sing Matchbox 20 at karaoke for the next year or so. Just wish it had went heavier on the social commentary. Gosling was amazing. As always. Robbie was perfect. As always. Just wish it hadn't pulled its punches.","22 Jul 2023",3

The question remains how could you balance between critiquing the thing, and using the same methods that reproduce the thing. Endless question and the two poles are always in contradiction. But it’s fair to say Greta is a genuine filmmaker. She’s v talented and most importantly honest. Overall, I really enjoyed the film. I really missed experiencing a movie in a fully packed cinema.

"taylor","Thank you Noah and Greta for this piece of whimsical fun. I think there were moments of pure genius, however a handful of jokes/ dialogue did not land for me but maybe that’s a me problem. Regardless, I was laughing and grinning so much throughout the movie and surprisingly tearing up at some moments too, which I had not expected. Perfect casting, perfect set, perfect wardrobe! Definitely would like to rewatch before they stop showing in theaters.","23 Jul 2023",4

"pedr0_ges","Esse filme é hilário, tipo poucas vezes eu ri tanto durante um filme, os personagens são em sua maioria engraçados e as piadas vão muito bem com a audiência. Margot Robbie como Barbie foi perfeita, e Ryan Gosling não poderia ter dado uma performance melhor como Ken, que as vezes até rouba o holofote da Barbie.","23 Jul 2023",3

"ValeryBloom","Nunca ""revivió el cine"" tuvo tanto sentido. Antes de ahondar en la película, quisiera decir que Barbie ha traído consigo un fenómeno que va mucho más allá del hype. Ver de nuevo las salas llenas, todo el mundo vestido de rosa, ilusionado e involucrado con la película, las risas, los ""ooooh"" cada vez que salía Allan.Barbie no es la mejor película de Gerwig. Para mí, su mayor acierto son las escenas paródicas e irónicas, que con gran criterio han…","21 Jul 2023",3
"vivi","personally i thought many scenes were a little corny, but otherwise it’s very very fun. obviously amazing costume/set design, and i loveddd margot robbie and ryan gosling.","22 Jul 2023",4
"maytecc","I think it’s very similar to like Lego movie in the sense that they both use a toy to criticize society. And I think this is a very good angle approach and I think the concept of Barbie was used to its max potential.But this meant that the liberal feminist might’ve been  over exploited so towards the second half of the movie I thought it had been overdone and that some characters were unnecessary.Margot Robbie is truly gorgeous…","21 Jul 2023",3

De la estética ni hablar, el juego con los colores. La última media hora es redudante, fuera de eso, espectacular. El humor es recontra cínico, mi favorito ah. Y después las referencias son increíbles también. En fin, un peliculón.","23 Jul 2023",5

"Aditya Saxena","Only ONLY good thing in the movie was Ryan's performance (I don't even like Ryan that much or his fandom) though only a cuck who wears tight tees would rate it above 3. Flash fans ain't in mud anymore their work isn't the biggest disappointment of the year.","23 Jul 2023",2

"Be","This is the silliest and most absurd movie to ever give me chills 10+ times and make me cry twice. Margot is my favorite actress and it’s well established that when she cries, I cry. So combine that with Greta’s direction and sensibilities and I never really stood a chance.","23 Jul 2023",4

"canguino","Dug it and its polyurethane dream so much that the few fumbles stung more than they otherwise would've. Not exactly a fault - and an enormous credit to Gosling - but it does have the Mickey Mouse problem of every character being more interesting than the one on the box, though Robbie leaves it all on the field. Will Ferrell almost kills the thing dead as a real-world villain somehow more cartoonish than the literal toys. Despite the killer button…","22 Jul 2023",5

Love that they got Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt to do the music. It really feels like Mattel let Greta Gerwig do whatever the hell she wanted and I think that's awesome. However, I'm not sure if the little girls seeing this movie will get anything out of this self aware and academic view point towards Barbie as a concept,…","22 Jul 2023",4
