# R_Letterboxed
 
Letterboxd is a social networking service for film enthusiasts, where users can rate, review, catalogue, and share their movie-watching experiences.

## Description
I scraped the comments of the new barbie movie right after it came out and compared the comments of different ratings with basic textanalysis 
- frequency analysis grouped by rating
- token correlations

### Results
The token correlations show, that the one topics that stood out in the negative ratings were "brand, mattel, patriarchy, sexism" and a cluster of "hard, sense, absolutely, time, makes".
Also "mattel" only appears in the bad ratings as one of the most common words.
