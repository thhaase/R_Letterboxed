While the initial 30 minutes left me uncertain about the film‚Äôs direction, it gradually unfolds into an interesting exploration of social constructs like matriarchy and patriarchy, prompting viewers to question these norms and embrace their authentic selves. While not groundbreaking, the film delivers its age-old message with humor, intelligence, and commendable acting and directing.

Fica evidente quando a Barbie afirma que Ken seja apenas O Ken, n√£o dependendo dela para ser algu√©m, assim com a Barbie nunca dependeu do Ken para ser quem ela √©.

The word patriarchy was repeated about 50 times in this movie I believe. The comedy was hit or miss for me. Some of the jokes were really funny and based on pretty clever irony, but others seemed like very hermetic kind of humor that only women would find funny. Moreover, the visuals are great, the music slaps and Ryan Gosling is as relatable as usual.","30 Dec 2023",5
