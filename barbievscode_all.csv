"splatoise","""Du hast die kognitive Dissonanz einer Frau im Patriarchat in Worte gefasst, und es damit seiner Macht beraubt!"" Ja, dieser impertinent gestelzte Satz kommt aus dem Mund von Margot Robbies Barbie-Figur, just nachdem America Ferreras Figur Gloria als Mensch im Barbieland eine inhaltlich zwar NATÜRLICH nahezu 100% zutreffende, aber an Vorschlaghammer-Plumpheit nicht zu überbietende Brandrede gehalten hat, um so das Barbieland zu retten.Auch beim Rewatch wird aus einem optisch sehr toll durchdachten, inhaltlich aber höchst fragwürdigen Barbie-Werbefilm nicht der…","31 Jan 2024",2

"Edwin Mondragon","Even better the second time. This is such a heartfelt movie and Barbies empathy is definitely admirable. The scene with Barbie and her creator Ruth, was really touching and emotional. At the end of it all, is just about being human and us defining our very own person. Barbies final “yes”, embracing her humanity despite knowing the imperfections and challenges that will come with being a woman, made me tear up. Yet, she welcomed it, with a tear and a smile, holding onto those beautiful moments of humanity and womanhood.","30 Jan 2024",5

"C. Y. Yeh","“Barbie” takes viewers on a colorful journey into Barbie Land, where Barbie and Ken navigate the transition to the real world, uncovering both its joys and perils. While the initial 30 minutes left me uncertain about the film’s direction, it gradually unfolds into an interesting exploration of social constructs like matriarchy and patriarchy, prompting viewers to question these norms and embrace their authentic selves. While not groundbreaking, the film delivers its age-old message with humor, intelligence, and commendable acting and directing. It may not be a must-see, but it’s a worthwhile watch, perhaps best enjoyed on a cozy Netflix night with ice cream.","22 Jul 2023",2

"foxfilmz","truly a lovely film. if you need to read barbie reviews to figure out if you should watch the movie, you're kinda a pathetic loser. i would consider this movie and artifact of womanhood. not only is the message of the screen play a one of a kind, the set and costume design was beautiful. Some people's concerns lie with how it is based off of a childhood toy but kind of doesn't really have that kid movie feel. that's what makes this movie so unique. the most powerful movie recent movie i've seen.","31 Jan 2024",4

Regardless of taste in films, the message is clear and important - I wish there was a little more subtly to it, but again it’s Barbie - rather than a gentle tap to the knee about feminism it was a stamp with a stiletto.

Die verrückten Sets, die vielen Barbies, Kens... und Alan... hier ist so viel Liebe zum Detail drin.Der Film spielt, zu meiner Überraschung, viel weniger in der echten Welt, als ich erwartet hätte.

It's great the criticism of corporate America is shown not only through the characters but the colors. It's great the movie treats Ken as a person and not just the opposition in the end. It's great the movie above all wants to say that history has been extremely unfair to women and it'll take…","29 Jan 2024",3
